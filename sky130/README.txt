Analog LIF Neuron for testing two types of synapses

The schematic was drawn with Qucs-S.
The simulator is Ngspice.
The spikes of injection are called from the file injection.pwl.

The original skywater pdk has include error in the file sky130_fd_pr__nfet_05v0_nvt.pm3.spice.
I fixed it in the pdk of the project.
